            </div>
        <p>Growing up my family owned a small restauant in Bangkok. My mother took care of the front of the house while my father cooked in the back. When we immigrated to this country I knew it was my calling to bring the flavors of Thailand to Raleigh. In 2003 my wife and I were able to save up enough money to open our flagship restaurant on 121 Big Wok Way. Today we have grown to four locations and we couldnt have done it without the amazing support we have received from this city! Thank you Raleigh!</p>
